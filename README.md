# 4-bit-ALU
Designed a 4-bit ALU with basic logic blocks. 

A complete solution with three 4-bit unsigned numbers A,B and C is capable to:
  - Compute the function F1= A+B+C
  - Compute a function F2 = A + B - C
  - Compute a function F3= 2â€™s complement of B
  - Compute F4 = (A/4) + B + C
  - Compute F5 = (A*2) + B + C
